Papyri.info XSLTs
=================

This folder contains most of the XSLT files used in the operation of the Papyrological Navigator.

Setup:
------

The PN XSLTs depend on a subversion checkout of the [EpiDoc XSLTs](https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Stylesheets/). This can be done automatically using [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) by running:

`rake setup`

in the pn-xslt directory. This will check out a copy of the EpiDoc XSLTs in a parallel directory.
