Papyri.info XSLTs
=================

This folder contains most of the XSLT files used in the operation of the Papyrological Navigator.

Setup:
------

The PN XSLTs depend on a subversion checkout of the EpiDoc XSLTs. This can be done automatically using Rake by running:

`rake setup`

in the pn-xslt directory. This will check out a copy of the EpiDoc XSLTs in a parallel directory.
